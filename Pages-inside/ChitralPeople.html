    <p>
        Chitral is a district which is located in the northwestern region of Pakistan.
        It is very well known for its peaceful people and beautiful landscapes, 
        mountainous region. Chitral is a very remote area and it is very hard to access
        it during winters because the roads are blocked and sometimes the only route left 
        is going through Afghanistan which is very dangerous due to the terrorist presence. 
        The people residing in kalash are thought to be of Turkish as well as Persian origin 
        but nothing is confirmed due to lack of information, another popular belief is that the 
        Kalash tribes are the direct descendants of the soldiers of Alexander the Great. 
        The houses of the Kalash people are made up of local stones and woods. These areas 
        do not have a lot of technology and they make a living out of crops such as lentils or wheat, 
        apart from that they also herd goats which helps them in their earnings.
        The people of Chitral and Kalash are also very famous for their extremely unique 
        dresses and dances which they carry out, they are very fond of music as well 
        (Specially the tribes of kalash). There are drums playing which the women would 
        dance in a circle and some elderly people would be sitting on the side and singing 
        old songs during festivals. All the dancing which takes place is supposed to be medium 
        to which the Kalash people thank their gods for everything that the Almighty has provided them with. 
        Women who are not married yet or are single are supposed to find themselves a husband or 
        man during these festivals. The culture of Chitral and Kalash is something which can be termed 
        as “inimitable” which generally means very hard or impossible to follow for other people. 
        In the southern region of Punjab you would find Kalash people who are known to be atheist 
        and keep their values and culture very close to them, they practice it for centuries and 
        it is an extremely old culture. A very important element of the Chitral Culture is “Mahraka”. 
        The meaning of Mahraka is basically is just a gathering of a group of people from the region, 
        and this gathering is headed by a religious leader from the majority. Age and wisdom are the only 
        two criterions which are required from people in order to be able to attend such gatherings, 
        which goes on to show that these are not for just any random person but serious matters are 
        discussed in it and high standards are set. Mahraka plays a very vital role when it comes to 
        the dissemination of ethnic culture and wisdom in the region. A lot of administrative problems 
        as well as other issues were discussed in this meeting of the elders and decisions were made. 
        There was proper dinner and food served at these meetings.</p>

            the latter is spoken a lot as well.
            Khowar (کھووار) or Chitrali, is an Indo-Aryan language primarily spoken in Chitral 
            and surrounding areas in Pakistan.
            Khowar is the lingua franca of Chitral and it is also spoken in the 
            Gupis-Yasin and Ghizer districts of Gilgit-Baltistan, as well in the Upper Swat district.
            Speakers of Khowar have also migrated heavily to Pakistan's major urban centres, with Peshawar, 
            Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi having significant populations. It is also spoken as a 
            second language by the Kalash people.</p>

        </ol>

        <p>There are various festivals which are celebrated in the district of Chitral 
            which people from other parts of Pakistan have most likely never even heard about. 
            One of such festivals is Jashn-e-Nowroz which is celebrated on 21st march every year. 
            This is basically a religion festival which is celebrated in the memories of a Sufi 
            saint who introduced the Ismaili faith in this region, the name of the Sufi Saint was 
            Peer Nasir Khisraw. Another very famous festival held in this region is the Shandoor Polo 
            festival, now everyone in Pakistan as well as around the globe is aware that Polo is played 
            in this region at 10,000 feet's above the sea level and this is not something very ordinary, 
            ordinary people have breathing issues at such heights but these people not only manage to breath 
            but play in such conditions which shows how strong and immune they are to these conditions. 
            The main event and match is between the teams of Gilgit and Chitral who are arch rivals. 
            This event is played normally during the summer because it is impossible to play 
            during the harsh weather which the winter brings, so normally the event is organized in the month
            of July annually.
            These were the main festivals celebrated in the Chitral district however the 
            tribes of Kalash have some of their own festivals which they celebrate which 
            are included as follows. Chilmijhust which is also known as Joshi is celebrated 
            during the spring harvest season which lasts for around 4-6 days every year. 
            This is followed by another festival in the month of August which is called Uchal. 
            During the month of December the festival of chitirmus which is celebrated with 
            great joy and to pray for a better year which is coming.</p>
